# bender-bot

A Python based Slack bot with OpenAI integration

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- [A Slack token](https://api.slack.com/apps)
	- Create a new Slack app from scratch
	- Add `chat:write`, `channel.history` and `app_mention` scopes for the Bot user
	- Install the app to your workplace
- An [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) for Chat capabilities
- A [Replica API key](https://replicate.com/account) for Image related features
- ngrok installed for development: `sudo snap install ngrok`

(Note: `slack` and `slackclient` are no longer supported. Please use `slack_bolt`.)

## Setup
- Setup pipenv: `pip install pipenv && pipenv shell`
- Install dependencies: `pipenv install`
- Launch the service with your Slack token: `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN='xoxb-xxxxxxxx' SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET='xxxxxxxx' OPENAI_API_KEY='xxxxxxxx' python3 index.py` 
- For development purposes, front the service with ngrok in a new window: `ngrok http 3000`. Note the returned ngrok endpoint. (**This url may change over time!**)
- On [Slack](https://api.slack.com/apps), provide https://<YOUR-NGROK-URL>.ngrok.io/slack/events as the endpoint under Event Subscriptions and Slash Commands.
